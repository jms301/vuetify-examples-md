Vuetify example.vue files as md files for context7 MCP


The vuetify docs don't generate .md files in a useful way for context7 to pull out the code examples as they .md files are intended to be run through vue and so the code examples are all imports which Context7 doesn't follow. 

So this is just a messy hack to quickly pull all the vuetify example.vue files into .md files that very roughly state what the code example is for. 

A much better job could be done!
